This pwa is related to the TCG Altered. Its purpose is to help players easily count the points present in each of the biomes of their expeditions.
There's a single-player mode and a 2-player mode, so you can use just one phone.

## How it works
You can increase or decrease the value of each biome in your expeditions using the arrows connected to them. You can also use the +1 or -1 boost to increase/decrease the value of all biomes in the desired expedition. You can also directly add the value of a character card using the "new character" button. Finally, the reset button sets the biomes of the 2 expeditions to 0. In 2-player mode, each of your biomes also indicates the value of the opponent's biomes.
